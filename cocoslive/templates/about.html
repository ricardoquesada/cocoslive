<p>cocos Live is a service that tries to help <span style="font-weight: bold;">iPhone Indie Game Developers</span> by giving them an API to solve their <span style="font-weight: bold;">online</span> requirements. cocos Live is a reliable service with good bandwith, since it is hosted in <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
</p>

<p>cocos Live is a free service. You can host as many games as you want in cocos Live. cocos Live, as it was mentioned before, is hosted in <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. All the services that are hosted in GAE, like cocos Live, have certain quota-limitations. If one game consumes most of the available quota (probably because it is a very successful game), the owner of the game will be asked if he can help to pay for additional quotas.
